# What's in My Food Project Prototype (Under Construction)

Team: OrcaOps
Hackathon: HackWave
Summary: "What’s in My Food" is an AI-powered app designed to empower Indian consumers with transparency about food safety. It scans and analyzes food labels, identifying harmful ingredients, allergens, and regulatory non-compliance, enabling informed dietary decisions.

## Project Vision

As health consciousness rises globally, Indian consumers are increasingly demanding transparency about the ingredients in their food. However, the Indian market often lacks accountability, exposing consumers to harmful ingredients like allergens, unsafe additives, and banned substances.

## Mission Statement 

To empower Indian consumers to make informed decisions about their diet and health by providing a transparent, AI-driven food analysis app.

## Problem Statement 

With the increasing prevalence of food-related health issues, there’s an urgent need for a reliable solution to identify harmful ingredients and allergens in food products. Existing solutions in the market, like Sift, Yuka, and Fooducate, primarily cater to US markets and focus on lifestyle features like weight loss or cosmetic products.

Key Issues Identified:

- India-specific concerns, including unsafe food additives and allergens.
- Limited personalization options in existing apps.
- Static databases without real-time updates or AI-driven insights.
- Lack of security focused apps prioritizing consumer safety over lifestyle features.

## Solution 

Key Features:
1. Health Risk Alerts: Flags allergens, unsafe additives, and banned substances.
2. Personalization: Tailors insights to individual sensitivities (e.g., gluten intolerance).
3. Nutritional Analysis: Highlights products exceeding dietary guidelines.
4. Simple Scoring: Color-coded ratings for easy understanding.

## Repository Information

The repo consists of the frontend of the prototype we displayed at the HackWave Hackathon 2024.
